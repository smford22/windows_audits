# windows_audit cookbook
This cookbook is a collection of Windows Chef Audit rules I've written for various purposes.
They are by no means comprehensive, but just meant to be a reference for me so I
can keep adding to them over time.

## Usage
The best way to test these rules out is to bring up an instance with [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/).
I am using a base box I built with [Packer](https://packer.io/) for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). My recommendation is to go that route.
